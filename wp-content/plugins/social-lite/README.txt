== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about data protection and third party processors? =
We attach great importance to data protection. Social only sends personal data to third-party providers if it is necessary to provide certain functions. The following third-party services are used by Social:

Freemius:
Social uses [Freemius](https://freemius.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements. Freemius SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users. Integrating Freemius SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.** Learn more about how [Freemius collects and uses this data](https://freemius.com/privacy/).
